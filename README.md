## 👋 About Me

I'm a passionate **Frontend Developer** with expertise in building responsive, performant web applications using modern technologies. I specialize in **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and modern CSS frameworks, with a strong focus on creating visually appealing designs and optimizing user experiences.

With professional experience at both **Fixed Mist (Fedis)** and **Giza Systems**, I've developed production-ready applications that solve real-world problems. I'm dedicated to writing clean, maintainable code and continuously expanding my skill set.

**🌟 Fun Fact:** I developed **Fetary** - an internal web app that transformed how my company manages daily breakfast orders, saving time and reducing errors!
